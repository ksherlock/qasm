Updating Help
=============

Make any edits, then:

1. Launch HTML Help Workshop
2. Open CiderPress.hhp
3. File > Compile

This should update the CiderPress.chm in the app/Help directory.  You can
copy it into the CiderPress directory, or just rebuild CiderPress to have
it copied automatically.

NOTE: pop-up text must be added to PopUp.txt, PopUpIds.h, and the
PopUpHelpIds table in MyApp.cpp.
