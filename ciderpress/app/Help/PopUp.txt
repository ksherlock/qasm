.topic IDH_DEFC_UNCOMPRESSED
Do not compress files.

.topic IDH_DEFC_SQUEEZE
The "SQueeze" format was popularized under CP/M by the "sq" and "usq" commands, which created ".QQ" files.  Commonly used as part of the Binary II application "BLU" to create .BQY files.  Generally inferior to LZW, it was rarely used once ShrinkIt was released.  Supported in NuFX archives by all versions of ShrinkIt, but due to program bugs only GS/ShrinkIt can actually unpack it.

.topic IDH_DEFC_LZW1
ShrinkIt's "Dynamic LZW/1" compression, part of the original ShrinkIt.  A combination of RLE and 12-bit LZW.

.topic IDH_DEFC_LZW2
ShrinkIt's "Dynamic LZW/2" compression, first introduced in GS/ShrinkIt.  A combination of RLE and 12-bit LZW.  Slightly more efficient than LZW/1, this algorithm is well-supported on the Apple II.

.topic IDH_DEFC_LZC12
This creates the same output as UNIX "compress", one of the early LZW compressors, restricted to 12-bit codes.  First introduced in the original NuLib utility, this format is supported by NuLib, NuLib2, and GS/ShrinkIt.

.topic IDH_DEFC_LZC16
Like LZC-12, but with 16-bit codes.  Performs better than 12-bit LZW, but the improvement is only noticeable on larger files.

.topic IDH_DEFC_DEFLATE
The "deflate" algorithm from zlib is used in ZIP archives, gzip ".gz" files, PNG graphics, and is defined by an Internet RFC.  It is currently one of the most common ways to compress data.  Its compression performance is considerably better than LZW, but support on the Apple II is limited.  Its use was first defined as a NuFX extension in NuLib2 v1.1.

.topic IDH_DEFC_BZIP2
The "bzip2" program uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) compression method.  It's slower and more memory-intensive than "deflate", but it does exceptionally well on large sets of text files or source code.  Support on the Apple II is nonexistent.  Its use was first defined as a NuFX extension in NuLib2 v1.1.

.topic IDH_CONVDISK_SPECIFY
Specify the size in 512-byte blocks.  The largest possible ProDOS volume has 65535 blocks (though 65536 is allowed for compatibility).  The smallest CiderPress allows is 16 blocks.

.topic IDH_PREF_EXTVIEWER_EXTS
List file extensions that should be opened in an external viewer when double-clicked from the file list.  For example, if you want to view GIF or JPEG images stored in a ShrinkIt archive or disk image, you should put "gif; jpg; jpeg" here.

.topic IDH_CONVDISK_SPECIFY_EDIT
Specify the size in 512-byte blocks.  The largest possible ProDOS volume has 65535 blocks (though 65536 is allowed for compatibility).  The smallest CiderPress allows is 16 blocks.

.topic IDH_CONVDISK_COMPUTE
Click this to compute the size required with the currently-specified options.  The computation is performed by creating a 32MB image and examining the number of blocks used.

.topic IDH_CONVDISK_SPACEREQ
The space required by the selected set of files with the current options.  Click the "Compute" button to calculate this.

.topic IDH_DEOW_CURRENT
If selected, ProDOS files are allowed to have lower case letters and spaces in them.  This can confuse older versions of ProDOS 8 (pre-v1.8), so only select this if you're using a recent version of ProDOS.

.topic IDH_TOPIC1306
If selected, empty blocks won't actually be stored.  Instead, the ProDOS "sparse" mechanism is used to indicate the existence of the empty space.  You should generally leave this enabled, as it can save considerable space.

.topic IDH_ADDFILES_CONVEOLTYPE
Select this to treat all files of type TXT or SRC as text files.

.topic IDH_TWOIMG_LOCKED
Indicates whether the "locked" flag is set.  Some emulators will use this flag to decide whether or not to treat the disk as write protected.

.topic IDH_TWOIMG_DOSVOLSET
If checked, a volume number is specified in the header.  If not checked, no number is specified, and the volume number edit field will be greyed out.

.topic IDH_TWOIMG_DOSVOLNUM
Volume number (1-254).  Some emulators use this field to emulate the sector-address-header volume number field.  Rarely useful.

.topic IDH_TWOIMG_COMMENT
The comment field is stored in the 2MG file, and can contain anything you want.

.topic IDH_PDISK_OPENVOL_RO
If enabled, the "read only" box will be checked by default on all Open Volume requests.

.topic IDH_PREF_REDUCE_SHK_ERROR_CHECKS
Disable some error checking on ShrinkIt archives.  Specifically, this ignores bad LZW/2 lengths (usually found in "bad Mac" archives) and bad data CRCs.  Leaving this enabled is a bad idea, because you may not discover corrupted data right away.

.topic IDH_PDISK_OPENVOL_PHYS0
If enabled, you will be allowed to open physical disk 0 for writing.  This is usually your Windows boot disk, so setting this is not recommended.

.topic IDH_PREF_SHK_BAD_MAC
If set, this attempts to recognize "bad Mac" archives, which have bad pathname separators ('?' instead of ':') and some bad data in the LZW area.
